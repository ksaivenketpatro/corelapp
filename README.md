# Steps to Run the React App

## 1. **Install Node.js**
Ensure Node.js is installed on your computer. You can download it from the official website: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). After installation, check the version by running the following command in the terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell for Windows, Terminal for macOS/Linux):

```
node -v
```

## 2. **Download the Project as a ZIP File**
- Go to the React App repository.
- Click on the green **Code** button and select **Download ZIP**.
- After the ZIP file is downloaded, extract it to a folder on your computer.

## 3. **Navigate to the Project Folder**
Open the terminal and go to the extracted folder. If you're using Windows, you can simply open the folder and use the address bar to type `cmd` to open the terminal in that folder. On macOS/Linux, use the terminal to `cd` into the extracted folder. For example:

```
cd path/to/extracted-folder
```

## 4. **Install Dependencies**
Inside the project folder, install the necessary dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```

This will download all the required packages specified in the `package.json` file.

## 5. **Run the React Application**
Once the installation is complete, start the React app by running:

```
npm start
```

The development server will start, and the application should automatically open in your web browser. If it doesn't, you can manually go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## 6. **Stopping the Server**
To stop the application, press `Ctrl + C` in your terminal
